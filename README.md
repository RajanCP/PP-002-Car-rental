# PP - 002 Car rental 

## Overview
This is my personal project based on a car rental.
<br/>This was based on a project from Web Design Mastery (https://webdesignmastery.github.io/Rental_07-09-24/).<br>
I tweaked the landing page and added my own sections like FAQ, Fleet model selector.
I used a tutorial to further my understanding on hamburger menus and the logo carousel.
